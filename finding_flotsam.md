##Finding Flotsam

The sailboard was an insect skittering southwesterly among the huge moving hills of water, carving a swooping wake through the foam-chained seas.

The sky was an insane gigantic ribcage high overhead. Under it rolled an endless waste of salt water, a tossing bleakness. The women were going to die there, fairly soon.

While the wind blew, striking up the terrible cross-chop, they couldn’t stop sailing. Couldn’t rest. They’d capsize, roll and tumble, be swept apart and drowned, if they attempted to heave to.

There were two of them, shipmates and lifemates, on the sailboard, naked in the warm cruel wind. 

Eastwind Shen, tall, darkskinned, whipcord-strong, sailed the board. She had been sailing for some twenty hours without respite. She was clearly a descendant of the Old Biologists’ whimsy: dark brown skin streaked with black; rich green hair flaring in the wind, burned silver at the tips and crown. 

Rahifa Ruan, a muscular sunbronzed woman with light sun-parched hair, crouched an an agonizingly cramped position just aft of the mast socket. Next to her was a float cage containing a small, scared rigging cat named Belladonna.

A horrifying squall at midnight had blown the sticks out of Limstrake, battering and capsizing the ship. Since then it had been a hell passage, with no hope beyond keeping the board sailing. Only one desperately skilled shift of balance and weight after another had saved them, hour after agonizing hour. Her muscles had cramped and trembled, but she had an almost inhuman command over her body.

Still, even Eastwind’s endurance was faltering; and the sun was sinking westward into another black bank of stormcloud. They would not survive that storm. Already she had almost fallen unconscious more than once, and only Rahifa’s urgent cries, and fierce grip upon her leg, had wakened her at the last moment.

Eastwind looked around for any sign of hope when the board crested the next vast swell, seeing no sign of the wind slackening with evening. Then she did see something, orange-lit with late sunlight.

A sail.

They dropped down the back of the swell, as Eastwind felt a thrill of hope before she could stop. Surely she had only imagined it?

“What is it?” Rahifa had noticed.

“Nothing, maybe…”

They lifted to the crest of the next swell, and there was nothing along the bearing on which she’d seen the sail.

Another swell, its crest broken and dirty and whipped with spray. Eastwind could see nothing.

The next swell was clean and high. _“Ship!”_ barked Eastwind.

“Where away?”

“West sou’west. Look like a schooner, some kind.”

“Can we get close enough?”

Eastwind ghosted a cracked laugh, leaned into the sail, and fell off a point.

                    \#

“I am Skoan Usad. You have come aboard the _Ragfin_, out of Heke’ah, bound for Flotsam. What are we to do with you?”

“_Do?_ We can work our passage,” said Rahifa, staring. “Damn good sailors, we.” Surely they would be pressed into service.

Captain Skoan Usad was not a reassuring figure. She looked like a mad old sea-thief out of a tale. Her ragged gray hair was tarred back like any common sailor’s; her face was seamed and scarred and hard; she wore a shoulder scarf and a short sarong; buckled at her belt was a steel scimitar with a worn, stained hilt. Her bare arms and legs were knotted with muscle.

The ship’s officers were equally grim and dangerous, a hard lot. 

The Healer and Figurator, a tall thin woman named Basilika, had a watchful piercing gaze that Eastwind didn’t like. But the worst was the Priestess, Dhagaska, a short, hunched figure in a slashed robe. In any other company, the Captain would have held any eye. But this wild woman with feathers and bones and sharks’ teeth bound in her hair had an impact. Her black-eyed gaze was sharp and it burned.

The sailors were a mixed lot: Paritids and Antarctic sailors. And there were some that were of a kind that Eastwind recognized as Bhalong: heavy, muscular women of paler skin, with an air of menace and violence. They came from the ports on the western coast of Osz. Eastwind knew something of Bhalong customs and culture, and had in fact encountered them before. She didn’t like them much, but respected them as fighters.

The _Ragfin_, though: the _Ragfin_ showed itself increasingly unpleasant. Trim and squared away, but not a good ship to be rescued by.

Clamped to the weather bulkheads were strange old wood and metal spars, which Eastwind gradually recognized as antique harpoons and lances from the Antarctic whaling trade. Killing cetaceans in their last refugia was a blasphemy to the Paritid religion and temperament.

The Captain kept a Slink, a low-slung biomix of lizard and wildcat, in a cage on the stern deck. Slinks were banned on all but the worst of ships.

The worst of it was the withered carcass of a Passage Bird atop the foremast, beak gaping to the sky, tattered wings stretched wide. It had apparently been nailed up there while still alive. Not only was this an evidence of a very dark Working, it made it certain that no other Passage Bird would ever guide them to their destination. Was the _Ragfin_ a wandering ship out of legend, doomed to sail the Gyres of Ocean until every sailor aboard was a walking dead woman?

                    \#

“Any woman aboard have any word against these castaways?” The Captain looked aloft at the groaning rigging, silhouetted against the storm roof that hurtled by overhead in long heavy-bellied streaks. 

The sailors looked at them. The Bhalong were tight-lipped and angry, spoiling for a fight, but had no cause. The Paritids, a rough crew, seemed content. The rest of the crew looked upon the newcomers with neither favor nor malice.

“I speak against them!”

The sailor was a gaunt, leather-tough woman with middling-dark skin and a heavy shock of blueblack hair. Her tight angry face was seamed with a weal down the side. She shouted in the droning and slightly stilted voice of a westerner. “I speak against her! She gives a false name, but I have seen her in other waters, on the Brass Ocean. Shipmates, this is no Paritid sailor. This is a bloody-gutted pirate! I have seen her on the deck of a ship where I sailed as ordinary. I saw her when the pirates grappled us and swarmed over the rail, and she was the first. She raged among us with steel, laughing as she killed my shipmates. And as I lay there bleeding under the bodies, the pirates took up a shout: ‘Afya! Afya!’ Not in twice a thousand years will I forget that shout, or that face. The green hair, dusted with silver. The black marks on brown.

“Shipmates! This is Afya Mankiller!”

There was a stunned silence; and then a low rumble of affectionate laughter. “Seiche Pikati, joker!” Seiche snarled at them. “No joke,” she said flatly.

Eastwind looked at the wild wiry sailor with mild confusion. “I have sailed the Brass Ocean, me. And I have heard the name of Afya, but I never yet had anybody say she was as pretty as me.” She tossed her head. “Ee. Dubious, seems.”

The Captain smiled. “This is no hard matter. Basilika is a woman of many talents.”

Eastwind’s face hardened. So the Figurator was also a Truthhearer…

Basilika moved to confront Eastwind. They were of a height. Eastwind’s pale green eyes shaded into silver as she stared angrily into Basilika’s dark gaze. “Ask, you,” she snarled. Basilika, unmoved, smiled slightly and began the interrogation.

Truthhearers have the specific gift, the ear for evasion and falsehood. That is the trap they drive their subjects into: always forcing the lie, the evasion. Truthhearers must be skilled in the matter of questioning, of forcing the person under question to run the maze of their own mind, and to pursue with questions. 

“How old are you? Where were you born? What ships have you sailed? Who was your worst First Mate? Have you ever sailed pirate? What seas have you sailed? What manner and make of ships have you crewed? Have you ever tried to kill your Captain? How did you get your name? What name did you have before that? Do you know the Brass Ocean? Have you ever hit port in Shadisaba? In Rumilki? What taverns did you visit in Rumilki? Were you ever called Afya?”

Basilika circled Eastwind’s mind, listening for the lie. Eastwind, increasingly angry and weary, spat her answers back without hesitation.

When it was over, Basilika turned to face the Captain. “Seiche Pikati is wrong. This woman is not Afya, nor any Brass Ocean pirate. I’ve looked into her, and it’s not there.”

                    \#

The Captain took their Oath while lightning flared in a dry darkening sky. Corposants flared, mists of electric fire, at masthead and boom, and clothed the piteous skeletal wreck of the crucified Passage Bird, swirling around its tattered remains. The sailors gaped in dread, and even the coarse hardfaced Bhalong cowered.

Skoan Usad laughed a great bellylaugh. Standing iron-dark against the freakish green-white play of lightning and corposant, she went to the Slink’s cage. The hunched beast stretched out of its confinement, and gathered itself to bolt away on some mad impulse of mayhem; but the Captain caught its choke-rope and mastered it. The beast snarled and slavered, looking up at Skoan with a reverence of hatred, but owning her its master. The Captain’s other hand held her scimitar.

“A great night of power!” cried the Captain. “A good night for an oath most binding!” She beckoned Eastwind and Rahifa to her. Evil though she was, and masterful, and cruel; still, something primitive, something of the sea, surged up in the newest members of _Ragfin_’s crew. They knelt, gripped by the Captain’s powerful voice as she rehearsed to them the terrible words. They were overborne, and they spoke the words of the corrupted Crew Oath, invoking the Shark God Arusimaté.

The Slink glared at the newest members of the crew with eyes like redbrown coals. Drool dripped from its fangs onto the deck.

“Let them be assigned: Rahifa to my watch, Eastwind Shen to the First Mate’s,” Skoan Usad shouted hoarsely. “And now hop to it, you fumblehanded idiots! The wind’s freshening! Get those sails shortened before it rips the canvas out of us!”

Rahifa, recovering from the dazed weight of the dreadful Oath, sprang forth, just as she had ever done, and was up the foremast faster than any other sailor on watch. Eastwind, off watch, knew that she had just done something she should never have done. No matter that she had had no real choice. That she and Rahifa would both have been killed if either refused the Captain’s heavy hand.

<i>Lasirenn, Beautiful Girl, help me,</i> she prayed.

But, whether Lasirenn, she who breathes the storm; Lasirenn, whose wonderful silken moonfan of a tail lifts the swells of the world; Lasirenn, with her hair of sunrise and sunset clouds; whether she heard, and was moved, or whether Eastwind’s oath to a different god had silenced her entirely; now Eastwind felt a groping deafness gripping her. She had always felt Lasirenn’s wry presence in her heart, and often heard the Goddess’s husky voice whispering secretly to her, there was only a sense of emptiness, a dead thick silence like thudding heartbeats.
 
<i>Lasirenn!</i> she called.

<i>Lasirenn… I have wandered too far. If you can hear me, know that I never meant this.</i>

                    \#

“What kind of cargo?” asked Lasirenn.

“Sailing light, we.” Squallbone Ponela, a squat muscular woman almost as darkskinned as Eastwind, said when Eastwind asked privately. They were aloft, shortening sail as dirty weather hissed and whipped around them. They had a hard time tricing up the square sail. The booming canvas fought them like a living thing as they gasketed it. 

“Hold in ballast. In the Captain’s cabin is a locked cubby. Man inside.”

Eastwind stared. “A _Man?_”

Squallbone nodded solemnly. “Male of human species. Exist, they.”

“Fist yourself. Seen Men before, me.” She tied another gasket. “So, add to everything: _Ragfin_ is a breeder slaver.” She shook her head in disgust. “Sell him to a breeding collective on Flotsam? For what, eh?”

“For eco-analyst, I hear, me. Flotsam one of the biggest weed raft on any ocean. Old Biologist use it for wartime dump, they. Horrible things. After centuries, the mutagen and wild speciation they calm down… but folk from Flotsam worth a lot to women trying to penetrate Wild Regions. So _Ragfin_ a slaver both ways.” 

“Watch yourself, you,” said Eastwind sharply. The footrope was slippery, and Squallbone was agitated. “Got to get this sail in and get back down on deck, we.” The wind’s howl was getting worse, and the hurtling clouds above were sinking down towards them, like the belly of some great dark beast.

<i>Lasirenn, what have we done, we? This cursed ship should sink.</i>

                    \#

The night was dark and muffled with cloud, but the wind was steady and not overly strong. No reason for the watch to be changed, nor even move about setting sails. The decks were dark, with only a few glints from shrouded lanterns. Eastwind looked up, studying the rigging, seeing no one aloft. The watch was gathered aft, speaking quietly. The sea rushed, the hull creaked, the rigging groaned in the moaning wind. A perfect night for this work.

Eastwind’s Old Biologist eyes were catlike in the gloom. The Watch Hexmark, which all of the _Ragfin_’s sailors must study at the beginning of the watch, was on the foc’sle bulkhead. She stole silently to it, crouched, and yielded to a deeper level of identity. A moment later she stood, Eastwind Shen no longer.

Tryggva Steinlaugsdottir looked out of Eastwind’s eyes: cool and appraising. She did not have Eastwind’s skills and knowledge, but she held in memory the awareness of the sailors on watch, and the layout of the Ragfin.

She brought out the darklight that Eastwind carried. It was indistinguishable from the smoking paraphernalia that sailors carried; but the tiny coal inside cast infrared light that normal human eyes couldn’t see. For her, it was as good as a bullseye lantern. The Hexmark’s black lines and fields, its scrolled calligraphy, formed a densely complex blur, a disc cut and inked and burned into the weathered gray wood. 

She studied the mark for some time, gradually understanding its purpose and nature. Then, with inhumanly steady hands, with ink and engraving tools and the hot element of the darklight, she began to make almost imperceptible alterations.

She would be back on other dark nights. And every time the sailors studied the Hexmark, it would work to undermine the Crew Oath, not to sustain it.

                    \#

The _Ragfin pushed_ south by west. Out of the Hot Storm belts of the tropics; down into the Ring, the outermost edge of the Gyre, where roaring easterlies rule the sea. Rahifa and Eastwind proved themselves good sailmakers and handy with a marlinespike, winning grudging admiration even from the Bhalong.

The ship traversed belts and knots of storm, but the skies gradually opened up: the Storm Roof lifted and broke up into howling east-to-west strakes of darkness, with the high skies showing white and gray and even blue. The sun began to show as a pale watery smear, and the moon a muffled glow streaked with dark bars at night, falling from the full on the Second’s watch. The huge swells, pushing down from the equatorial north, rolled the ship, and waves burst in spray.

Ragfin entered the interior of the Gyre. <i>Bad Water</i>, all of the southerners called it.

Storms in Bad Water come in short, violent clots and bludgeons, like tall dark fists standing up into the sky: soon over, leaving torn sails and tangles of parted lines.

The Bad Water was a strange sullen place, always more so as they penetrated more deeply. Great streaks and drifts and reaches of weed, amber and brown and dark red in the daylight, lay like mats and skins on the sea, gentling the waves and muffling even the great swells. The heavy winds bore a freight of moisture and warmth; they rushed across the surface, but were unable to raise waves except in the open intervals of water. Mist and spray moved in great lateral banks, blocking vision. The lookouts were fiercely vigilant aloft, crying out warnings of the floating masses of weed. When the _Ragfin_ plowed into a heavy bank of weed, sailors with poles (and in the worst cases, billhooks and long-hafted scythes made for the purpose) had to push and hack it away from the bow. Sail was shortened at night, because the ship dared not make speed unless the moon was unveiled and bright.

Unlike the marine deserts of the open ocean, Bad Water was a place of rich life. The water itself, unlike the deep blue of the outer oceans, had distinct tinges of green. Schools of fish shoaled around the weed, and many species of seabirds hunted and fished the area, often scooping up squids and less familiar tentacled creatures.

“How can we even _find_ Flotsam?” Rahifa mused as they shared a meal with a few of the other off-watch sailors.

“What do you mean, pretty girl?” leered one of the Bhalong, a big sailor named Hagga Sha. Rahifa, who didn’t like her, gestured impatiently. 

“No Radio. Not on _this_ ship, sure. And no Passage Bird going to come anywhere near.” She looked at the big sailor, watchful for anger. But the Bhalong just grinned wider. 

“Best step carefully, Paritid girl. Never know but what you might end up feeding our guide.” Hagga laughed silently. “Something got to feed it. Your little rigging cat maybe?” The sailor shrugged. “Too small—”

Hagga’s mistake was to assume that her size and strength would let her control a brawl. Rahifa was not only skilled, she was fast and strong. All would have been ordinary, except Rahifa broke Hagga’s collarbone. Hagga seemed shocked and horrified, then terrified. “Bitch,” she moaned. The other sailors, a rugged crew, laughed; except for the other Bhalong present: a thick-bodied woman that the others called Oko. Oko just calmly finished her meal, and looked at Rahifa with an assessing gaze.

For crippling a watchstander, Rahifa drew extra duty. When she went down into sick bay, Hagga was listless and terrified, and turned to the bulkhead, refusing to talk to her.

The meaning of it all was made sickeningly clear two days later. The _Ragfin_ had passed near enough through the center of the Gyre. It was the Captain’s watch, morning. The Bosun whistled the All Hands.

The crew assembled. The Captain looked at them. “We need a guide,” she began abruptly. “We cannot find Flotsam without it. The Shark God has seen our need, and filled it in a shipshape way.” She bent the weight of her gaze upon them. “Some of you are proven; women I can trust. Some of you not.

“But to remove all doubt, I call upon _all_ to submit, under authority of the Crew Oath.” The Captain’s voice rang out with a weight of solemn thunder, like a distant approaching storm. Each woman there felt irresistibly impelled to sink to one knee.

<i>This is bad</i>, thought Eastwind. <i>This is very bad</i>. But she could not stir. She could only kneel and look at the Captain.

“Good,” said the Captain. “Well done.” She raised her eyes. “Dhagaska, priestess of Arusimaté!”

“Aye, Captain?”

“Are you prepared to perform your office?”

“Aye, Captain!”

“Then begin! And may the Lord of the Deeps favor us.”

Dhagaska, carrying a carven club that seemed too heavy for a person of her stature, went below, into the deckhouse. Then there came a _boom_, and another. Eastwind realized that the Priestess was striking the mainmast where it plunged through the deckhouse to butt against the mast step on the keel.

Then the Captain uncaged her Slink, which snarled and huffed, apparently wishing nothing more than to race along the rows of kneeling sailors, ripping, snapping, and dismembering. As before, she kept it on a short leash, and did not neglect to keep her scimitar in hand.

After a time, at the Captain’s order, the Bosun went below to Sick Bay, and the palpable horror began. For she brought up, screaming and begging, Hagga, the sailor that Rahifa had crippled. Her terror was piteous to see. The bosun gestured to Oko, the other heavily muscled sailor who had been there when Hagga had been injured.
But, in the extremity of her terror, Hagga’s plunging loosened the Bosun’s grasp before Oko arrived to assist in whatever grim act was to be played. She ran, mindlessly shrieking, back toward the stern deck.

And the Captain, laughing like a queen of demons, released the Slink. It raced across the deck, paws thudding on the planks, horribly fast for such a short-legged creature, snarling in wild excitement. It passed shockingly close to some of the kneeling sailors, but was apparently the kind of hunter that fixes upon a single prey. It passed them, and from astern came hideous sounds, chopping and snapping, mingled with desperate screaming that gradually faded.

The Captain slapped her thighs as if someone were telling an uproarious story in a tavern. The sailors could not turn; they were compelled by the Crew Oath to keep their eyes upon Skoan Usad.

The Captain then went to fetch the Slink, and as the sailors turned to watch her, they saw the Bosun and Oko throwing something like a bundle of bloody rags over the side. There came a splash, then silence… and then a terrible disturbance in the water.

The Captain dragged her bloody-mawed Slink to its cage. Almost it seemed that it would not go in, but the Captain bent her gaze implacably on the beast, and gradually its snarls faded. It lowered its gaze, bent its head, and went into the cage. The Captain shut it with a clack, and secured it. She turned and looked at the crew, seeming in very good spirits indeed.

“Crew Oath: released!” the Captain sang out. The sailors, wan and fearful for the most part, did not know where to go.

“A woman to the top to watch our guide! Those off watch, come forward and see what manner of guide we have!”

Out ahead of the _Ragfin_ some hundred and fifty meters was a shark of unbelievable size. Its dorsal fin stood clear of the water, perhaps half the height of a woman.

Later, Eastwind asked permission to speak to the Captain. She, still in a great good mood, allowed it.

“How, Captain, does Shark have any idea where to find Flotsam?”

The Captain nodded approvingly, as if Eastwind had just taken and computed a difficult star sight. “What is the first thing you see about that shark, Eastwind Shen?”

“...Fucking huge, Captain.”

She nodded approvingly again. “Sharks have a lateral line—you know what that is?”

“A stripe down the fish’s side, that can feel and localize low-pitch disturbances.” Then Eastwind’s jaw dropped. “Captain… Does _Flotsam_ emit such sounds?”

The Captain nodded again. “Flotsam does! What their cause is, or what purpose they might have, I do not know. Flotsam has many mysteries. But when your shark is _long_ enough…”

For just a moment, Eastwind Shen felt a common fascination with the bloody-handed monster who ruled the horrible ship.

                    \#

The _Ragfin_ made good time, following the Great Shark. At first its course meandered; but as they sailed ever further to the west southwest, the fish appeared to settle in.

The topic of feeding the Shark was much studied in the foc’sle. Some of the Bhalong said that the Shark would need to be fed another time or two before the journey ended. Whether they said that to terrify their shipmates, or because it was true, no one could say.

                    \#

The breaking point came when Rahifa heard Belladonna screaming. The genuine distress in the sound brought her running.

What she saw was Oko—Oko who had sat by when the unfortunate Hagga Sha had mocked her about feeding Belladonna to the guide—gripping the little cat tightly in her monstrous hands. The Captain was approaching, her Slink on a long lead.

Rahifa’s brilliance was in prompt action, not thought. She drew her knife and waited around the side of the deckhouse. Listening… waiting…

Belladonna squalled in fury and terror, clawing and biting at Oko, writhing without effect in her iron grip. The Slink prowled lazily forward, its great jaws slavering, tail lashing. Oko watched it narrowly, clearly waiting to judge the time to throw the little animal to the monster.

Rahifa, a blur of swift hard motion, leaped upon the Slink, stabbing it deeply into its ribcage. Her sailor’s knife was not long, but it was stout and sharp. The Slink roared and screamed, and whirled swift as a snake, fanged jaws lunging towards Rahifa. She struck it on the side of its head with the knife-hilt, knocking it aside. The Bhalongs nearby lunged forward, then gave back in terror as the frenzied Slink, bright madness burning in its eyes, whirled again, menacing any who came near.

<i>“Crew Oath,”</i> Skoan Usad shouted in her great gravelly voice. “Rahifa Ruan, I call you to <i>obedience!</i>”

Caught in the backwash of that great powerful shout, most of the crew faced the Captain in full submission. Rahifa, against whom it was directed, halted, fell to one knee, staggered and gripped by the power of the unlawful oath. She looked up at the Slink, that was now snarling at her, lashing its tail.

When it turned again, gathering its powerful haunches to spring upon Rahifa, a sudden graybrown streak leaped upon its back, and clawed at its eyes in passing: Belladonna, whom Oko in shock had let free. The rigging cat narrowly missed the furious snap of those jaws.

The Slink shrieked in fury. One of its eyes was torn and leaking, blinded by the cat’s strike. The other glared with a greater madness, as it cast about, looking for any victim. The crew in terror scattered back. The Slink’s eye fell upon the Captain, and suddenly it sprang at her, howling. The Captain, roaring in fury, and either too wise to flee from the Slink or too enraged, sprang to meet it. Her scimitar swept up in a glittering arc, then fell, splitting the Slink’s skull - the skull whose jaws had locked, in dying spasm, on the arm she had used to defend herself in that swift spasm of violence. Her scimitar clattered to the deck as she wrenched those terrible jaws back and forth, tearing her arm further, until she could break the lower jaw by main force.

Most of the crew stood in shock. Only one figure on the deck moved with full cognizance and speed: Dhagaska the shark priestess, who pounced at Belladonna the Rigging cat that crouched hissing on the starboard ladder. Belladonna almost escaped, but the priestess gripped the little cat’s tail. With a shout of gratified hatred, the priestess hurled the cat over the port rail. Belladonna screamed as she went.

The Captain, in her desperation and pain, had lost command of her voice. Belladonna’s scream jolted Rahifa back to herself. Running between the other sailors, she vaulted the rail, and dove cleanly into the waters below, swimming to the desperately struggling cat.

The First Mate shouted, but what she wished to say was silenced as Eastwind fell from aloft, striking the officer with her heels. The First’s back broke with a horrid _crack_ and she fell to the deck, shuddering and flailing her arms, not knowing what had happened to her. She rose with the Captain’s scimitar in one hand, and then, with astonishing strength, hauled the heavy, injured Captain to her feet. The sailors shouted and lunged at her as she dragged the stumbling captive across the deck to fetch up against the port gunwale. The Captain, injured and shaken, nonetheless drew a dagger and struck at Eastwind. Eastwind checked it with the scimitar near the hilt, bearing in with a terrible strength matching the Captain’s.

For a moment they stood thus, straining, interlocked, razor edges of steel mere inches from throats, faces, breasts. Then, with a rasp and a roar, the Captain shouted out again, <i>“Crew Oath! Obedience!”</i>

Eastwind looked into the Captain’s eyes, her own slits of silver fury. And she began to laugh. “Eastwind’s not here,” she hissed. <i>“I am Afya now.”</i> With a sudden twist she wrenched the Captain’s dagger out of her grasp. It fell to the deck, burying its tip in the deck planking.

Then, with a cunning stoop and lift and roll of shoulder, she threw Skoan Usad into the sea.

<i>“Woman overboard!”</i> she shouted. <i>“Hard aport!”</i>

<i>“Hard aport!”</i> echoed the First Mate in an agonized shriek, using a voice that had pierced many a storm. “Spring to it, you slugs! The Captain’s gone overboard!”

The crew braced the yards around then, shrinking away from Afya, who stood, hard-faced, brandishing the Captain’s scimitar. As the ship swung and heeled, she could see the bright gold of Rahifa’s hair, and the Captain too, swimming.

Then, behind her, she heard Dhagaska’s club hammering against the mast, thundering out the call to the Great Shark.

With a wordless ringing shout, Afya sprang across the deck and down into the deck cabin. 

Dhagaska’s laughter turned to a hissing fury. She whirled, strong with long practice, and then struck at Afya with the drumming club. Afya gave briefly against the blow to let it whirr past, then slashed with dreadful precision. The club fell to the deck, and so did Dhagaska’s hands and wrists.

The priestess, staggering, staring at her spurting arm stumps in horror, began to wail in horror as Afya whirled and raced back up on deck.

The _Ragfin_ was heaving to, neatly, blocks clattering and squealing, canvas snapping in the wind. “Aloft!” Afya sang out. “The Shark! Where away?”

After a moment, the Shark Watch called back down, “Sounded!”

Afya cursed with a foul piratical oath. “Prepare to bring crew aboard from the sea! Get the ladders out, you scumdrinking spermjacking shit-for-brains! Three of you follow me!” The pirate’s voice was a whipcrack of command, and some sprang to help as she went to the stern cabin bulkhead.

One sailor though, a Bhalong, drew her longknife and menaced Afya. “You’re no captain of mine!” she screamed, and lunged forward, the knife a blur of drillwood, getting inside the scimitar’s reach. Skilled as she was at rough fighting on the deck, her skills were no match for Afya Mankiller, who shifted and short-thrust. The Bhalong fell to the deck, throat opened, choking her life out.

Afya went to the old evil whaling lance mounted on the bulkhead, and began to pry at the brackets with her knife. The sailors gaped at her. “That fuckless shark will be upon us in moments!” she shouted. “We’ve got women over the side!” At that they began to pry at the brackets in earnest.

Afya and her shipmates had just got the old weapon free, and brought it to the rail, when the shark watch sang out, “Shark below, close astern!” And then it came.

Like a moving gray hill surfacing under the water, the monster’s immense head lifted out of the dull depths. It came from underneath, gape-jawed, an ambush predator. Under Rahifa and the cat.

Rahifa kicked out desperately to avoid the strike. She just managed it, but the huge body hurtled up next to her, the dorsal fin striking her ribcage with crushing force. She somehow kept Belladonna in her arms as the suction of the monster’s lift slammed her into the shark’s abrasive flank again,flaying her skin.

Then, with a sobbing curse that was half prayer, Afya threw the lance.

Lances are for thrusting, not throwing, but the throw went true. Its chisel-shaped head struck the huge shark in the gills, striking through to jut from its other side. In agony, the great animal curved and crashed into the water, hurling a huge wave and blast of bloody spray - and then it sank into the deeps again, and was gone, back to the Deeps that were its home, to die soon of its wound or to live, transfixed by the lance. Merciless though she was, she spared a thought of pity for the terrible brute. It was merely a predator. The cult of Arusimaté had drawn it into evil service.

“Rahifa!” shouted Afya. “Grab the line, girl!” For a Paritid sailor had skillfully cast a coil of line within easy reach. Rahifa’s strong grip closed on the hemp, and the sailors drew her in, pulling towards the ladder that had been dropped over the side.

At the same time, some of the Bhalong had cast a line to the Captain. They all gently drew in. “Avast there!” Afya sang out. “Rahifa comes up the ladder first.” The Bhalong rounded on her, hostile, rolling their eyes and gnashing their teeth. They drew their long knives. Afya smiled grimly.

She sprang toward them, then ducked aside as they leaped at her, blades hissing close.

They drove her back, rushing across the deck. But this was a woman who had danced through ankle-deep blood on more than one vessel. She had no time to draw her own knife, but she didn’t need it. Slipping aside, shifting, fading, she led them back toward the aft cabin. Their fierce blows missed her, or left thin red slices on her dark skin. But then another sailor bounded to the deck behind her. Her knife sank into Afya’s back, but not far, striking the shoulder blade and halting there for a moment. Afya threw herself forward, a splash of blood trailing from her back, bright red against the jet-black skin there. She staggered three steps forward—and then went down, to hands and knees, but her hand fell unerringly on the hilt of the scimitar.

Afya Mankiller rose from the deck with a bound like a catapult releasing, howling a berserk shriek, the whirl of the scimitar no more silver than her mad molten eyes. The sailors flung themselves upon her.

Against Afya, famous pirate of the bloody Brass Ocean, that sinewy growling rush seemed slow and cumbersome. She flowed around and through them, dancing, slicing, surefooted. Their blows missed. Hers did not. In moments, three Bhalong and one Antarctic sprawled on the rolling deck, dead or dying. Afya shook her head, mumbling through smashed lips, “What other bitches.” She spat, coughed, shook her bloodstreaked silvergreen mane, shouted, “<i>What other bitches</i> want to say I’m not the Captain? Come forth, as many of you as dare! Come forth, sadpuppies, and I’ll spill your guts until the honest crew can scarce walk the deck!”

She was a terrible sight, tall, gaunt, brown and black, slashed with wounds, blood from a shrewd slash on her forehead leaking down into her eyes, gripping a blood-clotted sword that dripped on the deck.

“Nay, Afya!” shouted Seiche Pikati. “I knew you, did I not? I knew you, and I will sail with you. I will sail with you, pirate or merchant!” The small scrawny woman whirled. “What say you, shipmates?”

At first the Paritids, and then, by twos and threes, the entire surviving crew of _Ragfin_ shouted their acclaim. Basilika, the ship’s Figurator, nodded, looking at Afya with dark, narrow eyes.

Squallbone and a couple of others were hauling the ladder. Belladonna clung to the ladder’s ropes; below her Rahifa, much injured, plainly beyond moving anymore, had hooked her arm through the rungs; and below that, Skoan Usad.

The rigging cat crawled up onto the gunwale, protesting in her thin voice. Then Rahifa was within reach, and Afya shouldered her way to gently lift the girl, taking care for the broken bones and torn skin, but also with some haste lest the Captain manage one more stroke with the dagger.

Skoan Usad snarled, removed the dagger from her mouth, and chuckled. “You do not have my ship yet, Eastwind Shen. No—Afya, the name is. You shall fight me with your knife.” Her  face was gone in mad hatred. Her horrid knotted muscles swelled. Then she shouted, with that hoarse booming voice, “<i>Crew Oath!</i> Obey and take the castaways!”

The Oath had been considerably frayed by Tryggva’s night work on the Watch Hexmark, and Skoan Usad was hurt and hanging over the side, where her command could not be well heard. Nonetheless, so mighty was her Captain’s voice that the crew faltered and looked from side to side, not knowing what to do. Afya, holding Rahifa as gently as she could, was trapped. She surged back to get away from the rail—but then a huge grip fell upon her arms. The giant Bosun grinned down at her.

Afya chose that moment to yield to Tryggva Steinlaugsdottir. Tryggva became aware behind Eastwind’s eyes. Tryggva felt Afya’s skill and ferocity leave her; but she knew what she had to do. She sang out, with a clear crisp voice, the Oration she had prepared in the watches of the night, while she labored over the Hexmark.
It was not really a proper Oration—far too simple and brief. But this Oration served only a single purpose: to disrupt one particular influence. It was crafted solely to break the grip of the _Ragfin_’s Crew Oath. Tryggva cast it in one long compelling cry.

The sailors, freed at last of the brutal hold of that Oath, seemed like women trying to recall a memory from long ago. But one terrible exception was the Bosun, who followed Skoan Usad, and worshipped Arusimaté, because she chose to. Her crushing grip on Tryggva’s arms relaxed not at all… and then Skoan Usad, bloody, grinning, a monster, heaved herself up to the rail, right in front of Tryggva.

Tryggva’s mind went white and blank. She was a scholar and Figurator, not a warrior like Afya nor a brawler like Eastwind. She had done what she needed to do, but now it seemed all for nothing. She watched Skoan’s knife rise for a terrible stab, and could think of nothing to do.

The giant shark erupted again out of the depths then, enraged, biting in a frenzy. It surged up in a horrible gray mass, its jaws closing on Skoan Usad’s body, and some of the hull strakes, with a terrible grating crunch. Skoan’s eyes widened in horrible incomprehension, and then she was dragged away and down with another huge splash.

Eastwind came aware again. She no longer had Tryggva’s command of the acts of the inner mind, and could only vaguely remember the act of casting the Oration, but the Oration itself still resonated in her. The Crew Oath was lifted.

And Eastwind was more than capable of dealing with the Bosun.

The _Ragfin_, under Eastwind’s captaincy, seemed to throw off the sullen miasma of evil as it pressed west by south, heading out again to the Ring. The Bosun lay in sick bay, her jaw shattered and teeth splintered. The corpse of the Shark Priestess had been cast over the side, drawing the immediate attention of some of the lesser sharks that haunted the weed drifts. All agreed that this was ecologically fitting.

The whaling weapons were broken up, the shafts burned and the irons salvaged: steel that had been put to evil purposes could be made clean again in a forge. Basilika, silent and withdrawn, scoured, replotted, and regraved the Watch Hex to more wholesome purpose.

Squallbone and Seiche went up the foremast top and reverently brought the mummified Passage Bird down.

Rahifa also lay in sick bay, and did not prosper. Basilika had put forth all of her skill, and sung all of the healing charms she knew, but Rahifa was grievously hurt and sailed her own journey in the Death Sea. Belladonna neglected her pest-catching duties shamefully, lying next to Rahifa and purring without pause. “She’s calling her back,” the sailors said.

As they approached the Ring, the skies changed again. Eastwind, at a particularly wild sunset, climbed the maintop and cried with all her heart to Lasirenn. <i>Come and speak with me, Beautiful Girl. Come and find me again, you. My love lies dying, she... and my ship has no guidance.</i> The words seemed to echo away into the high clouds and under the water. At long last, the flat muffled dullness of her spiritual ears opened out.

<i>“Well enough,”</i> came Lasirenn’s reply, faint, but growing clearer. <i>“Well enough… Have you learned not to traffic with horrible works? You like those shark cults, eh?”</i>

Eastwind recalled with a sick sensation what it had been like to take the Crew Oath and to swear by the Shark God. Shamed, she let that memory flow to Lasirenn.

<i>“Arusimaté. He and I, we have battled down the centuries. We hate one another dearly... You couldn’t avoid this. But don’t ever fuck up like this again.”</i>

Tears streamed down Eastwind’s dark face. <i>Thank you, Lasirenn. Never leave you again, me.</i> The wild clouds, like brooms and feathers, flared out around the setting sun.

“Your hair is so beautiful,” she whispered aloud.

The next morning, the sailors saw a wonderful and heartening thing. A Passage Bird, looking translucent in the predawn air, winged in from astern and perched on the foretop. They knew it was their guide to Flotsam.

“How many of you are there?” asked Basilika one evening, idly, as _Ragfin_ plunged through the roaring sequence of storms and clear thundering wind that marked the Ring. She and Eastwind were on the stern deck, smoking. “I’ve seen Afya and Tryggva.”

Eastwind shrugged. “Few more. How many, not even entirely sure, me. I’m newest, youngest. My predecessors don’t tell me everything. Secretive, they.” Her pipe glowed as she puffed on it. “But they made me for a reason. Primary, I am, now.”

“This is a secret you wish kept.”

“Yes. You tell anybody, soon I have to construct another voice, another personality, supersede me.”

“Strange life.” Basilika’s voice was meditative.

“Life I have, me.”

They had Flotsam in sight, the morning that Rahifa woke. Wrapped in bandages. She smiled brilliantly at Eastwind, a lover’s smile. Basilika, standing on the bed’s other side, eyes glistening, nudged her head No.

“Hey love,” said Eastwind. “Like to get some fresh air, you? Flotsam’s off the starboard bow, and it’s a beautiful morning out there.” The rigging cats stretched. Belladonna headbutted Rahifa gently.

“Consensus, seems,” the patient said. 

It was a glorious morning, with a lifting wind from the south. _Ragfin_ was close hauled on the port tack. They listened to the crush and splash of the hull and the song of the wind in rigging. The rising sun burned redgold off the port quarter. 

Flotsam was a vast wrinkled arc, partly cloaked in mist. Centuries of wind and wave had humped it up into a series of ridges and folds, fading inland. The swells broke against the near shore in a white froth, but Eastwind suddenly realized that Flotsam trailed underwater reefs behind it, and great waves towered up there. The wind was offshore, and it pressed the breaking waves into glorious peaks of glittering blue and green. Rahifa saw it too, and smiled. “What wonderful breaks,” she murmured.

They lay on a bench, Eastwind’s arms around Rahifa. The rigging cats snuggled up against Rahifa’s other side, purring and croaking.

“Eastwind,” said Rahifa. “Remember surfing together at Petals Reef? You carried me in your arms and on your shoulders, you.”

“Yes.” Eastwind smiled. “Together on the board, we, standing. I held you. You put out a foot, and cut the face of the wave with your toe.”

“That was the third best time, in all my life, me,” Rahifa said. “...I think I go to Makarita now.”

“No, Rahifa, stay with me a while longer.”

“Can use a drink, me,” Rahifa said dreamily. “But I will stay with you a little longer.”

“Eastwind, it’s getting cold. Kiss me.” And her lips were cold indeed.

“Eastwind… I’m glad we are here, and glad I saw this. Promise me…”

“Anything,” Eastwind said.

“Take me surfing on those breaks.”

“Yes. I will take you surfing.”

Rahifa smiled, and lifted her face to kiss Eastwind again, and looked out at the breaks of Flotsam. Her eyes were bright and clear. “Why, there it is!” she cried. And Rahifa Ruan never spoke again.

The rigging cats mewed and purred and tried to warm their girl, but their great hearts could not bring her back. And Lasirenn’s blazing hair unfurled overhead, in a deep blue sky that spoke of storms to come, next day, or the day after.
