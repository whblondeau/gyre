##Finding Flotsam

###The Fingerbones

The sailboard was an insect skittering among the huge moving hills of water. It carved a swooping, desperate wake down their gigantic faces.

The Storm Belt, the marine desert of the equator. A terrible place to be adrift. The sky above was a fretwork of strange, hard-edged formations, the ones that Paritid sailors call “Iffr’s Fingerbones”. Thin glassy, knobby tubes of supersonic wind, the Fingerbones blast from west to east, energy sinks for the overheated equatorial atmosphere.

One of those Fingerbones, following a local concentration of surface heat, had plunged down from its high-altitude home the night before; had lowered a knuckle to rap the sea. The schooner _Limstrake_, bound for the seaboard cities of the Gautsas with a cargo of spices and glassware, had had little warning when the droning, boneshaking shriek fell through the hot inky darkness above. Little warning, and no chance. The Fingerbone ripped the sticks out of _Limstrake_, hurling them over the side in a ruined welter of cordage and spars, breaking the keel at the mainmast step. Then it had passed on to brush the water’s surface in a huge explosive burst, blasting the stricken ship’s decks with roaring foam and lifting a short sharp wall of water.

As suddenly as it had come, the Fingerbone lifted back into the darkness, leaving cold crisp air in its wake, leaving fogs that boiled from the warm waters and were whipped away by the lesser surface winds.

The two women and one small rigging cat on the driven sailboard were, so far as they knew, the _Limstrake_'s only survivors.

The women were Paritid sailors; shipmates and lifemates. They were naked but for knife belts in the warm cruel wind. They were very different from one another. Eastwind Shen, tall, darkskinned, whipcord-strong, sailed the board, and had been sailing for some twenty hours without respite. Rahifa Ruan, muscular, sunbronzed, with a shock of light sun-parched hair, crouched in an agonizingly cramped position just aft of the mast socket. Next to her, the float cage containing Belladonna the rigging cat was secured. 

Since they’d escaped the foundering ship in a mad black chaos of choking foam and roaring wind, it had been a hell passage, with no hope beyond keeping the board sailing for another minute, another thirty seconds. Time and again, Eastwind had nearly wiped out on the plunging walls of dark water. Only one desperately skilled shift of balance and weight after another had saved them. Hour after agonizing hour she’d ridden the ragged swells and waves, balancing the sail against the switch and blast of the wind, in darkness, by feel alone. 

Daylight had been a welcome relief. But they were going to die there in the Storm Belt, die fairly soon, because the day was falling towards evening and the wind would not stop blowing.

The harsh hot north wind, cutting across the huge lumbering swell. While it blew, they couldn’t rest. The seas were too violent. They’d capsize, roll and tumble, be swept apart and drowned, if they attempted to heave to.

Eastwind could not stop. Rahifa, to her anguish and shame, could not take a turn sailing the board: she had not Eastwind’s uncanny skill at surfing and board sailing. All she could do was watch, and help. Especially she watched Eastwind, watched lest her weary head droop towards sleep.

Eastwind was clearly a descendant of the Old Biologists’ whimsy: her dark brown skin streaked with broad black decorative marks, rich green hair flaring in the wind, burned silver at the tips and crown. She looked out at the ocean that would kill them all with hard, unforgiving eyes of celadon graygreen. Her muscles cramped and trembled, but she had an almost inhuman command over her body, and a will as hard as drillwood.

Still, even Eastwind’s endurance was faltering; and the sun was sinking westward into a black bank of stormcloud. They would not survive that storm. Already she had almost fallen unconscious more than once, and only Rahifa’s urgent cries, and fierce grip upon her leg, had wakened her at the last moment.

Eastwind looked around for any sign of hope when the board crested the next vast swell, seeing no sign of the wind slackening with evening. Then she did see something, orange-lit with late sunlight.

A sail.

They dropped down the back of the swell, as Eastwind felt a thrill of hope before she could stop. Surely she had only imagined it?

“What is it?” Rahifa had noticed.

“Nothing, maybe…”

They lifted to the crest of the next swell, and there was nothing along the bearing on which she’d seen the sail.

Another swell, its crest broken and dirty and whipped with spray. Eastwind could see nothing.

The next swell was clean and high. _“Ship!”_ barked Eastwind.

“Where away?”

“West sou’west. Look like schooner, some kind.”

“Can get close enough, we?”

Eastwind ghosted a cracked laugh, leaned into the sail, and came up a point.

						#

The ship was fast. A three-masted topsail schooner, raked masts, with a low sleek hull, running wing and wing before the wind. To fail to catch the ship was death for all of them.

The thundering reach to intercept the distant ship was an agony. Any lesser surfer than Eastwind would have lost it. She hurtled from crest to crest, crashing, crunching the spray outward in sheets, recklessly catching the wind under the sail to lift them over the worst of the chop. She heard poor Belladonna crying out: Paritid rigging cats are the bravest of the crew, but this was nothing she had been bred for. Rahifa crooned to the cat, trying to comfort her. Then, when they were airborne from one swell crest to another, Rahifa laughed aloud and whooped. _Lasirenn, Beautiful Girl,_ Eastwind, who had never been lucky in love, prayed. _Let my girl and her cat survive this._

Their only chance was to get close enough to the ship to be spotted. If the ship was slack, with a poor lookout kept, night and storm would swallow the board’s small sail, and the ship would never stop. That would be a night with no dawn the castaways would ever see.

<i>Lasirenn, help those lunkheads notice us, they. And soften their hearts if they do. Don’t let them leave us to die, us.</i>

Whether Lasirenn, she who breathes the storm; Lasirenn, whose wonderful silken moonfan of a tail lifts the swells of the world; Lasirenn, with her hair of sunrise and sunset clouds; whether she heard, and was moved, or whether it was just the course of events, the gray dark rags of cloud to the west were torn apart, and burning redgold beams of sunset swept across the sea. They struck the sailboard, lighting its sail like a torch against the gathering darkness of evening behind them.

A lookout on board the schooner apparently did her duty. The schooner, in a breathtaking display of seamanship, jibed through the wind, hauling around on the port tack. On its new heading, it swept up toward the sailboard, clearly intending to take the wind from them. Eastwind gauged her course against the schooner’s—it wasn’t drifting downsea very fast, but it would need to heave to.

Eastwind slowed and came up another point.

They were going to live.


###The _Ragfin_

“I am Skoan Usad. You have come aboard the _Ragfin_, out of Heke’ah, bound for Flotsam. What are we to do with you?”

“_Do?_ Work our passage, we,” said Rahifa, staring. Surely they would be pressed into service? “Any ship sail Storm Belts need six, five extra hand. Goddess-forgotten _good_ sailors, we.” Eastwind, spent and trembling, with rushes of blackness across her sight, was content to let Rahifa speak for them. “Besides. Rigging cat here with us. Good cat, she. This ship could use more cat.” Rahifa's quick seaman's eye hadn't missed the disturbing flickers of motion aboard the _Ragfin_: small furtive crawlings and lifted jointed legs. Arthropod pests of various sorts—stingbeetles, dead sisters, scorpids, conespiders—infested ships, if not kept in check by predators. Paritid rigging cats, with their opposable thumbs, prehensile tails, rugged immune systems, and lightning reflexes, were among the best bugkillers.

“Been bitten, me. Been stung. Don't need further those marks.” Rahifa, well aware that she spoke insult, looked flatly at the Captain. The Captain returned stare for stare, and a slight snarl besides.

Captain Skoan Usad was not a reassuring figure. She looked like a mad old sea-thief out of a tale, glaring out of pale blue-gray eyes at the world, the ocean, glaring at any woman she saw. Her ragged gray hair was tarred back like any common sailor’s; her face, breast, and limbs were seamed and scarred and hard. She wore a shoulder scarf and a short sarong. Buckled at her belt was a steel scimitar with a worn, stained hilt. Her bare arms and legs were knotted with muscle.

The ship’s officers and Bosun looked grim and dangerous, a hard lot, cruelty and violence stamped into their faces. The Healer and Figurator, a tall thin woman named Basilika, seemed less wicked in frame and feature than the rest, but had a watchful piercing gaze that Eastwind didn’t like.

The worst of them all was the Priestess, Dhagaska, a short, hunched figure in a slashed robe. In any other company, the Captain would have commanded full attention. But this wild woman with feathers and bones and sharks’ teeth bound in her hair drew the eye. Her black-eyed gaze was sharp, and it burned. She looked at the castaways as if she knew something they did not.

The Captain's snarl suddenly relaxed into a slight grin. “Rigging cat, eh? Yes, I think we can use another rigging cat.” There came a slight stir from the crew. One or two snorts of quiet, unsettling laughter. “And we can use more hands, it's true enough. If you're as clever as your mouth, and run as fast.”

The sailors were a mixed lot: Paritids, Antarctics, Racha. And there were some that were of a kind that Eastwind recognized as Bhalong: heavy, muscular women of paler skin, with an air of menace and violence. They came from seaports on the western coast of Osz. Eastwind knew something of Bhalong customs and culture, and had in fact encountered them before. She didn’t like them much, but respected them as fighters. The Captain was one of them.

The _Ragfin_, though. As Eastwind looked around them in the day’s last light, the _Ragfin_ showed itself increasingly unpleasant. Trim and squared away, but not a good ship to be rescued by.

Clamped to the weather bulkheads were strange old wood and metal spars, which Eastwind recognized as antique harpoons and lances from the Antarctic whaling trade. Killing cetaceans in their last refugia was a blasphemy to the Paritid religion and temperament.

There was a Slink, a low-slung biomix of lizard and guardcat, in a cage on the stern deck. Slinks were banned on all but the worst of ships.

The worst of it was the withered carcass of a Passage Bird atop the foremast, beak gaping to the sky, tattered wings stretched wide. It had apparently been nailed up there while still alive. Not only was this an evidence of a very dark Working, it made it certain that no other Passage Bird would ever guide them to their destination. Was the _Ragfin_ a wandering ship out of legend, doomed to sail the Gyres of Ocean until every sailor aboard was a walking dead woman?

As Rahifa and Eastwind eyed one another, the last rays of sunset faded, and the heavy black clouds closed in towards them.

						#

“Any woman aboard have any word against these castaways?” The Captain looked aloft at the groaning rigging, silhouetted against the storm roof that hurtled by overhead in long heavy-bellied streaks. Foam hissed along the _Ragfin_’s sides, and great dark swells rolled the ship from side to side.

The sailors looked at them with neither favor nor malice, except for the Bhalong.

“Big tan women don’t like us, they,” murmured Rahifa.

“Bhalong; like nobody, they.” Eastwind, studying the sneering paleskinned sailors for genuine signs of trouble, was reassured.

“I speak against them!”

The sailor was a gaunt, leather-tough woman with middling-dark skin and a heavy shock of blueblack hair: a  Racha of the Brass Ocean. Her tight angry face was seamed with a weal down the side. She pointed at Eastwind, and shouted, “I speak against her! She gives a false name, but I have seen her in other waters, on the Brass Ocean. 

“This is no Paritid sailor. This is a bloody-gutted pirate from my own waters! I have seen her with my own eyes, when the pirates grappled us and swarmed over the rail, and she was the first. She laughed as she killed my shipmates with a steel sword. And as I lay there bleeding under the bodies, the pirates took up a shout: <i>‘Afya! Afya!’</i> Not in three lifetimes would I forget that shout, or that face. The green hair, dusted with silver. The black marks on brown. This is Afya Mankiller, shipmates!”

There was a stunned silence; and then a low stir. “Seiche Pikati, joker!” someone said uneasily. Seiche snarled at them. “No joke,” she said flatly.

Eastwind, baffled by the passionate denunciation, looked at the wild wiry sailor. “I have sailed the Brass Ocean, me. And I have heard the name of Afya, but I never yet had anybody say she was as pretty as me.” She tossed her head. “Ee. Dubious, seems.”

The Captain smiled. “This is no hard matter. Basilika is a woman of many talents.”

Eastwind’s face hardened. So the Figurator was also a Truthhearer…

Basilika moved to confront Eastwind. They were of a height. Eastwind’s pale green eyes shaded into silver as she stared angrily into Basilika’s dark gaze. “Ask, you,” she snarled. Basilika, unmoved, smiled slightly and began the interrogation.

Truthhearers must be skilled in the matter of questioning, of forcing the person under question to run the maze of their own mind, and to pursue with questions. This, of course, all interrogators must know. But Truthhearers have the specific gift, the ear for evasion and falsehood. That is the trap they drive their subjects into: always forcing the lie, the shading of the truth. It soon became clear that Basilika’s ruthless prying thought was great indeed.

“How old are you? Where were you born? What ships have you sailed? Who was your worst First Mate? Have you ever sailed pirate? What seas have you sailed? What manner and make of ships have you crewed? Have you ever tried to kill your Captain? How did you get your name? What name did you have before that? Do you know the Brass Ocean? Have you ever hit port in Shadisaba? In Rumilki? What taverns did you visit in Rumilki? Were you ever called Afya? Again, what manner of ships have you crewed? Have you fought duels? With what weapons?”

Basilika circled Eastwind’s mind like a shark, taking bites, listening for the lie. The officers and crew listened in fascination. Eastwind, increasingly angry and weary, spat her answers back without hesitation.

When it was over, Basilika turned to face the Captain. “Seiche Pikati is wrong. This woman is not Afya, nor any Brass Ocean pirate. I’ve looked into her, and it’s not there.”

Seiche Pikati hissed her disapproval.

Eastwind studied the sailor with troubled eyes, then shook her head.

The small woman spat on the deck.

						#

The Captain took their Oath while lightning flickered in the dry darkening sky. Corposants flared, mists of electric fire, at masthead and boom, and clothed the piteous skeletal wreck of the crucified Passage Bird, swirling around its tattered remains. The sailors gaped in dread. Even the coarse hardfaced Bhalong cowered.

Skoan Usad went to the Slink’s cage. The hunched, scale-armored beast stretched out of its confinement, and gathered itself to bolt away on some mad impulse of mayhem; but the Captain caught its choke-rope and mastered it. The beast snarled and slavered, looking up at Skoan with a reverence of hatred, but owning her its master. The Captain’s other hand held her scimitar.

“A night of power!” she cried, standing iron-dark against the freakish green-white play of lightning and corposant. “A good night for an oath most binding!” She beckoned Eastwind and Rahifa to her. They knelt, gripped by the Captain’s powerful voice as she rehearsed to them the terrible words.

Evil though she was, and masterful, and cruel; still, something primitive, something of the sea, surged up in the newest members of _Ragfin_’s crew. They were overborne, and they spoke the words of the corrupted Crew Oath, invoking a god neither had heard of: the Shark God Arusimaté. They felt the weight of the Oath fall upon their shoulders like a sodden net.

The Slink glared at the newest members of the crew with eyes like redbrown coals. Drool dripped from its fangs onto the deck. The Captain pulled it back to the sterndeck.

“Let them be assigned: Rahifa to my watch, Eastwind Shen to the First Mate’s,” Skoan Usad shouted hoarsely. “And now hop to it, you fumblehanded idiots! The wind’s freshening! Get those sails shortened before it rips the canvas out of us!”


Rahifa, recovering from the dazed weight of the dreadful Oath, sprang forth, just as she had ever done, and was up the foremast faster than any other sailor on watch. Eastwind, off watch, knew that she had just done something she should never have done. No matter that she had had no real choice.

<i>Lasirenn, Beautiful Girl, help me,</i> she prayed.

<i>Lasirenn!</i> she called.

But where she had always felt Lasirenn’s wry presence in her heart, and often heard the Goddess’s husky voice whispering secretly to her, there was only a sense of emptiness, a dead thick silence like thudding heartbeats.

<i>Lasirenn… I have wandered too far. If you can hear me, know that I never meant this.</i>


###Down to the Gyre

The _Ragfin_ pushed south by west, heading for the Great Gyre.

They left the tall frightening skies of the Fingerbones, and the uneasy mountainous seas, behind as they passed out of the Storm Belt. Lower-altitude storms they still had in plenty. Lightning-shot squalls, like the one that had attended Rahifa and Eastwind’s Crew Oath ceremony, still rushed past them or over them. The crew worked themselves ragged—taking sail in and then hoisting it, by turns.

Rahifa and Eastwind proved out. They were always quick to spring to any dangerous or hard task; good aloft in dirty weather. Sails they had gasketed didn’t blow loose. Eastwind, with her Old Biologist eyes and endurance, was especially valuable in the rigging at night. Both were good sailmakers and handy with a marlinespike. They soon earned the trust of the watch officers and even gained the grudging respect of the Bhalong.

Being new to the crew, and both attractive women, they were challenged. Eastwind and Rahifa were old hands. They took their lumps, responded within measure, left no permanent hatreds. 

						#

“What kind of cargo?” asked Eastwind.

“Sailing light, we.” Squallbone Ponela, a squat muscular woman almost as darkskinned as Eastwind, said. They were aloft, shortening sail as dirty weather hissed and whipped around them. They had a hard time tricing up the square sail. The booming canvas fought them like a living thing as they gasketed it. 

“Hold mostly in ballast. Some Siberian silk, black drillwood from Efun. Could carry more easy, but special delivery cargo.” She scowled down at the flapping canvas. “Locked cubby in the Captain’s cabin. Man inside.”

Eastwind stared. “A _Man?_”

Squallbone nodded solemnly. “Male of human species. Exist, they.”

“Fist yourself. Seen Men before, me. Talk to them sometime.” She tied another gasket. “So, add to everything: _Ragfin_ is a breeder slaver.” She shook her head in disgust. “Sell him to a breeding collective on Flotsam? What they get paid for him, eh?”

“Trade for eco-analyst, I hear, me.” She put a gasket in her teeth, gathered another length of sail, secured it. “Ever been Flotsam?”

“No. Hear about it. Women say Makarita there.” Makarita is the Paritid legend of the afterlife, the seaport that may never be visited by the living.

“Women say. Women say shark-puke nonsense all kind. Flotsam one of the biggest weed raft on any ocean. Old Biologist use it for wartime dump, they. Horrible things. After centuries, the mutagen they decay or get chelated. And wild speciation they calm down… but folk from Flotsam worth a lot to women trying to penetrate Wild Regions. Afreyk, say, or up in Matau maybe. So _Ragfin_ a slaver both ways.” She snarled and shook her head as if trying to shake off a conespider or scorpid.

“Watch yourself, you,” said Eastwind sharply. The footrope was slippery, and Squallbone was shaking her head too hard from side to side. “Got to get this sail in, get back down on deck, we.” The wind’s howl was getting worse, and the hurtling clouds above were sinking down towards them, like the belly of some great dark beast.

<i>Lasirenn, what have we done, we? This cursed ship should sink.</i>

Only muffled silence answered.

						#

The night was dark and muffled with cloud, but the wind was steady and not overly strong. No reason for the watch to be changed, nor even move about setting sails. The decks were dark, with only a few glints from shrouded lanterns. Eastwind looked up, studying the rigging, seeing no one aloft. The watch was gathered aft, speaking quietly, smoking. The sea rushed, _Ragfin_ rolled slowly, the hull creaked, the rigging groaned in the moaning wind. A perfect night for this work.

Eastwind’s Old Biologist eyes were keen as a cat’s in the gloom. The Watch Hexmark, which all of the _Ragfin_’s sailors must study at the beginning of the watch, was on the foc’sle bulkhead. She stole silently to it, crouched, and yielded to a deeper level of identity. A moment later she stood, Eastwind Shen no longer.

Tryggva Steinlaugsdottir looked out of Eastwind’s eyes: cool and appraising. She did not have Eastwind’s skills and knowledge, but she held in memory a rough awareness of the layout of the Ragfin, and the location and duties of the sailors on watch.

She brought out the darklight that Eastwind carried. It was indistinguishable from the smoking paraphernalia that sailors carried; but the splinter of evercoal inside cast infrared light that normal human eyes couldn’t see. For her, it was as good as a bullseye lantern. 

The Hexmark was a disc cut and inked and burned into the weathered gray wood. Its black lines and fields, its scrolled calligraphy, formed a densely complex blur. She studied the mark for some time, gradually understanding its purpose and nature. Then, with inhumanly steady hands, with ink and engraving tools and the hot element of the darklight, she began to make almost imperceptible alterations.

She would be back on other dark nights. And every time the sailors studied the Hexmark, it would work to undermine the Crew Oath, not to sustain it.



###Sailing Bad Water

The _Ragfin_ sailed down into the Ring, the outermost edge of the Gyre. Roaring easterlies ruled the sea there, and a heavy roof of cloud rushed overhead in oily streaks.

The ship, rolling and heeling on a beam reach, still dodged knots of storm, but as they traversed the Ring the skies gradually opened up: the roof of cloud lifted and broke up into tatters and fringes, with the high skies showing white and gray and, as they pushed south, even gradually darkening blue.

Some three days in, _Ragfin_ entered the interior of the Gyre. Bad Water, all of the southerners called it. The sun began to show as a pale watery smear, and the moon a muffled glow streaked with dark bars at night, falling from the full.

Storms in Bad Water come in long, heavy bulks, with a weight of wind and lashings of rain. In the outer parts of Bad Water, there was rigging to be mended most watches. But gradually, the burden of heavy weather eased, because the center of Bad Water was clogged with increasing masses of floating weed.

Great streaks and drifts and reaches of seaweed, amber and brown and dark red in the daylight, lay like mats and skins on the surface, gentling the waves and muffling even the great swells. The heavy winds, with their freight of moisture and warmth, rushed across the surface, but were unable to raise waves except in the open intervals of water. Mist and spray moved in great lateral banks, blocking vision. The lookouts were fiercely vigilant aloft, crying out warnings of the floating masses of weed. When the Ragfin plowed into a heavy bank of weed, sailors with poles (and in the worst cases, billhooks and long-hafted scythes made for the purpose) had to push and hack it away from the bow. This was heavy work; and they would curse the lookouts roundly. Sail was shortened at night, because the ship dared not make speed unless the moon was unveiled and bright, so that the floating weed would show rough against the silvery surfaces, or the waves would indicate clear water.

Bad Water was a place of rich life. The water itself, unlike the deep blue of the outer oceans, had distinct tinges of green. Schools of fish shoaled around the weed, and many species of seabirds hunted and fished the area, often scooping up squids and less familiar tentacled creatures.

Fleets of delicate bubbles, which the sailors told Eastwind trailed deadly venomous tendrils far below the water, floated with airy lightness. Some colorless and some blue or purple, they drifted together, making most other creatures stand off. They would glitter in the sunrise especially, when the early burning light of dawn would lance through the fire-edged banks of low cloud.

Other wonders were to be seen in Bad Water. One day the lookout called out, “Eyes o’ the sea, two points off the starboard bow,” and such sailors as were awake and about clambered into the rigging for a closer look. To Rahifa, who went up into the crow’s nest and cajoled a look through the spyglass, the Eyes of the Sea seemed like a strange framework, as of masts and yards but subtly organic in form, floating on the distant sea. As they passed closer, maybe half a mile, it showed giant eyeballs socketed at various high points, looking this way and that. For a moment, one great eye, showing a bright yellow-green iris, stared back directly at her. She had the strange feeling that a vast intelligence, great as the sea, inspected her at this distance, the huge eye resolving her shape to its satisfaction; and stared into her, and dismissed her. 

Then the great eye roved on, and a shudder took her. She handed the spyglass back to the lookout, who smirked.

“Takes everyone that way, does.”

						#

“How can we even find Flotsam?” Rahifa mused as they shared a meal with a few of the other off-watch sailors.
“What do you mean, pretty girl?” leered one of the Bhalong, a big sailor named Hagga Sha. Rahifa, who didn’t like her, gestured impatiently.

“No Radio. Not on this ship, sure. And no Passage Bird going to come anywhere near.” She looked at the big sailor, watchful for anger. But the Bhalong just grinned wider. Rahifa, seeing something in the grin, reckoned that Hagga might have been appealing—if she hadn’t long ago decided that it was more fun to be a scumspider.

“Best step carefully, Paritid girl. Never know but what you might end up feeding the Captain's Slink.” Hagga laughed silently. “Something got to feed it. Your little rigging cat maybe?” The sailor shrugged. “Too small—”

Hagga’s mistake was to assume that her size and strength would let her control a brawl. Rahifa was not only skilled, she was fast and strong. All would have been ordinary, except Rahifa broke Hagga’s collarbone with an elbow strike. Hagga seemed shocked and horrified, then terrified. “Bitch, you kill me, bitch,” she moaned. The other sailors, a rough crew, laughed or looked at Hagga curiously; a broken collarbone was no great matter.

For crippling a watchstander, Rahifa drew extra duty. When she went down into sick bay, because she felt somewhat bad about it, Hagga was listless and terrified, and turned to face the bulkhead, refusing to talk to her.

						#

The meaning of that was made sickeningly clear two days later. The _Ragfin_ had passed near enough through the center of the Gyre. It was the Captain’s watch, morning. The Bosun whistled the All Hands.

The crew assembled. The Captain looked at them. “We need a guide,” she began abruptly. “We cannot find Flotsam without it. The Shark God has seen our need, and filled it in a shipshape way.” She bent the weight of her dread gaze upon them. “Some of you are proven; women I can trust. Some of you not.

“But to remove all doubt, I call upon _all_ to submit, under authority of the Crew Oath.” The Captain’s voice rang out with a weight of solemn thunder, like a distant approaching storm. Each woman there felt irresistibly impelled to sink to one knee.

_This is bad,_ thought Eastwind. _This is very bad._ But she could not stir. She could only kneel and look at the Captain.

“Good,” said the Captain. “Well done.” She raised her eyes. “Dhagaska, priestess of Arusimaté!”

“Aye, Captain?”

“Perform your office! And may the Lord of the Deeps favor us.”

Dhagaska, carrying a carven club that seemed too heavy for a person of her stature, went below, into the deckhouse. Then there came a _boom_, and another. Eastwind realized that the Priestess was striking the mainmast where it plunged through the decks to butt against the mast step on the keel. The resonance was strange and chilling.

Then the Captain uncaged her Slink, which snarled and huffed, apparently wishing nothing more than to race along the rows of kneeling sailors, ripping, snapping, and dismembering. As before, she kept it on a short leash, and did not neglect to keep her scimitar in hand.

After a time, at the Captain’s order, the Bosun went below to Sick Bay, and the palpable horror began. For she brought up, screaming and begging, Hagga, the sailor that Rahifa had crippled. Her terror was piteous to see. The Bosun gestured to Oko, another Bhalong sailor who had been there when Hagga had been injured.

But, in the extremity of her terror, Hagga’s plunging loosened the Bosun’s grasp before Oko arrived to assist in whatever grim act was to be played. She ran, mindlessly shrieking, back toward the stern deck.

And the Captain, laughing like a queen of demons, released the Slink. It raced across the deck, paws thudding on the planks, horribly fast for such a short-legged creature, snarling in wild excitement. It passed shockingly close to some of the kneeling sailors, but was apparently the kind of hunter that fixes upon a single prey. It passed them, and from astern came a crescendo of hideous sounds, chopping and snapping, mingled with desperate shrieking that gradually faded to a wheezing despair, and then ceased.

The Captain slapped her thighs as if someone were telling an uproarious story in a tavern. The sailors could not turn; they were compelled by the command under Crew Oath to keep their eyes upon Skoan Usad.

The Captain then went to fetch the Slink, and as the sailors turned to watch her, they saw the Bosun and Oko throwing something like a bundle of bloody rags over the side. There came a splash, then silence… and then a terrible disturbance in the water, like a wave breaking on a reef.

The Captain dragged her bloody-mawed Slink to its cage. Almost it seemed that it would not go in, but the Captain bent her gaze implacably on the beast, and gradually its snarls faded. It lowered its gaze, bent its head, and went into the cage. The Captain turned and looked at the crew, seeming in very good spirits indeed.

“Crew Oath: released!” the Captain sang out. The sailors stood, wan and fearful for the most part, not knowing where to go.

“A woman to the foretop to watch our guide! Those off watch, come forward and see what manner of guide we have!”

Out ahead of the _Ragfin_ some hundred and fifty yards swam a shark of unbelievable size. Its dorsal fin stood clear of the water, perhaps half the height of a woman.

Later, Eastwind asked permission to speak to the Captain. She, still in a great good mood, allowed it.

“How, Captain, can the shark have any idea where to find Flotsam?”

The Captain nodded approvingly, as if Eastwind had just taken and computed a difficult star sight. “What is the first thing you see about that shark, Eastwind Shen?”

“It’s… fucking huge, Captain. Never heard of such.”

She nodded approvingly again. “Sharks have a lateral line, you know what that is?”

“A stripe down the fish’s side, that can feel and localize low-pitch disturbances.” Then Eastwind’s jaw dropped. “Captain… Does _Flotsam_ emit such sounds?”

The Captain nodded again. “Flotsam does! What their cause is, or what purpose they might have, I do not know. Flotsam has many mysteries. But those sounds travel thousands of miles. And when your shark is _long_ enough…”

For just a moment, Eastwind Shen felt a common fascination with the bloody-handed monster who ruled the horrible ship.



###The Shark

The _Ragfin_ made good time, following the guide shark. At first its course meandered; but as they sailed ever further to the west southwest, the fish appeared to settle in.

The weather grew stormier, and the night Shark Watch was a misery, on the foremast, peering through the darkness, knowing that anyone who would lose sight of the Shark would probably be fed to it.

The topic of feeding the Shark was also much studied in the fo’c’sle. Some of the Bhalong said that the Shark would need to be fed another time or two before the journey ended. Whether they said that to terrify their shipmates, or because it was true, no one could say.

The breaking point came when Rahifa heard Belladonna screaming. The genuine distress in the sound brought her running.

What she saw was Oko—Oko, the Bhalong who had sat by when the unfortunate Hagga Sha had mocked her about feeding Belladonna to the Slink—gripping the little cat tightly in her monstrous hands. The Captain was approaching, with a partly-disguised eagerness, her Slink on a long lead.

Rahifa’s brilliance was in prompt action, not thought. She drew her knife and waited around the side of the deckhouse. Listening… waiting…

Belladonna squalled in fury and terror, clawing and biting at Oko, writhing without effect in her iron grip. The Slink prowled lazily forward, its great jaws slavering, tail lashing. Oko watched it narrowly, clearly waiting to judge the time to throw the little animal to the monster.

Rahifa, a blur of swift hard motion, leaped upon the Slink, stabbing it deeply into its side, once, twice. Her sailor’s knife was not long, but it was stout and sharp. The Slink roared and screamed, and whirled swift as a snake, fanged jaws lunging towards Rahifa. She struck it on the side of its head with the knife-hilt, knocking it aside. The Bhalongs nearby lunged forward, then gave back in terror as the frenzied Slink, bright madness burning in its eyes, whirled again, menacing any who came near.

“_Crew Oath,_” Skoan Usad shouted in her great gravelly voice. “Rahifa Ruan, I call you to _obedience!_”

Caught in the backwash of that great powerful shout, most of the crew faced the Captain in full submission. Rahifa, against whom it was directed, halted, fell to one knee, staggered and gripped by the Oath's unlawful power. She looked up at the Slink, that had ceased to snap at its own side, and was now snarling at her, lashing its tail.

When it turned again, gathering its powerful haunches to spring upon Rahifa, a sudden graybrown streak leaped upon its back, and clawed at its eyes in passing: Belladonna, whom Oko in shock had let free. Then the rigging cat was off and away, narrowly missing the furious snap of those jaws.

The Slink shrieked in fury. One of its eyes was torn and leaking, blinded by the cat’s strike. The other glared with a greater madness, as it cast about, looking for any victim. The crew in terror scattered back, all of the Bhalongs drawing their long knives. The Slink’s eye fell upon the Captain, and suddenly it sprang at her, howling. The Captain, roaring in fury, and either too wise to flee from the Slink or too enraged, sprang to meet it. Her scimitar swept up in a glittering arc, then fell, splitting the Slink’s skull—the skull whose jaws had locked, in dying spasm, on her other arm. The scimitar clattered to the deck as she wrenched those terrible jaws back and forth, flaying her arm further, until she could break the lower jaw by main force. The Slink’s body, still feebly thrashing and coiling in death, thudded to the deck.

Most of the crew stood in shock, hindered by the Captain’s last invocation of the Oath. But one figure on the deck moved with full cognizance and speed: Dhagaska the Priestess, who pounced at Belladonna where she crouched hissing on the starboard ladder. Belladonna almost escaped, but the priestess seized the little cat’s tail. With a shout of gratified hatred, the Priestess hurled the cat over the port rail. Belladonna screamed as she went.

The scream jolted Rahifa back to herself. Running between the other sailors, she vaulted the rail, and dove cleanly into the waters below, swimming to the desperately struggling cat.

The First Mate shouted, but what she wished to say was silenced as Eastwind fell from aloft, striking the officer with her heels. The First’s back broke with a horrid _crack_ and she fell to the deck, shuddering and flailing her arms, not knowing what had happened to her. Eastwind rolled and sprang, moving so swiftly that the rest of the crew seemed slow and foolish. She rose with Skoan Usad’s scimitar in one hand, and then, with astonishing strength, hauled the heavy, injured Captain to her feet. The sailors shouted and lunged at her as she dragged the stumbling captive across the deck to fetch up against the port gunwale. The Captain, injured and shaken, nonetheless drew a dagger and struck at Eastwind. Eastwind checked it with the scimitar near the hilt, bearing in with a terrible strength matching the Captain’s.

For a moment they stood thus, straining, interlocked, razor edges of steel mere inches from throats, faces, breasts. Then, with a rasp and a roar, the Captain shouted out again, <i>“Crew Oath! Obedience!”</i>

Eastwind looked into the Captain’s eyes, her own slits of silver fury. And she began to laugh. “Eastwind’s not here,” she hissed. <i>“I am Afya now.”</i> With a sudden twist she wrenched the Captain’s dagger out of her grasp. It fell to the deck, burying its tip in the deck planking.

Then, with a cunning stoop and lift and roll of shoulder, she threw Skoan Usad into the sea.

<i>“Woman overboard!”</i> Afya shouted. <i>“Hard aport!”</i>

<i>“Hard aport!”</i> echoed the First Mate in an agonized shriek, using a voice that had pierced many a storm. “Spring to it, you slugs! Captain’s gone over the side!”

The crew braced the yards around then, shrinking away from Afya, who stood hard-faced, brandishing the Captain’s scimitar. She had no wish to interfere with their handling of the ship. As the ship swung and heeled, she looked out at the sea. She could see the bright gold of Rahifa’s hair, and the Captain too, closer aboard.

Then, behind her, she heard Dhagaska’s club hammering against the mast, thundering out the call to the great Shark. _Sacrifice_, the message went out.

With a wordless ringing shout, Afya sprang across the deck and down into the deck cabin. Two sailors sought to block Afya’s rush; but she was no longer Eastwind Shen. It was Afya Mankiller they confronted. A slash, a shift, a grate and crunch, bright sprays of blood—then they were struck down in a horrible shambles of blood and brains, and she was leaping over them.

Dhagaska whirled in fury, sprang, and struck at Afya with the drumming club. The pirate gave back briefly to let it whirr past, then slashed with dreadful precision. The club fell to the deck, and so did Dhagaska’s hands and wrists.

The priestess, staggering, staring at her spurting arm stumps, wailed in unbelieving horror as Afya whirled and raced back up on deck.

The _Ragfin_ was heaving to, neatly, blocks clattering and squealing, canvas snapping in the wind. Afya raced to the rail, looked out, saw the Captain swimming. Rahifa, a good swimmer, had closed the distance to the ship.

“Aloft!” Afya sang out. “The Shark! Where away?”

After a moment, the Shark Watch called back down, “Sounded!”

Afya cursed with a foul piratical oath. “Prepare to bring crew aboard from the sea! Get the ladders out, you  spermjacking scumdrinking shit-for-brains! Three of you follow me!” The pirate’s voice was a whipcrack of command, and some sprang to help as she went to the aft cabin bulkhead.

One sailor, a Bhalong, drew her longknife and menaced Afya. “You’re no captain of mine!” she screamed, and lunged forward, the knife a blur of drillwood, getting inside the scimitar’s reach. But, skilled as she was at rough fighting on the deck, her skills were no match for Afya Mankiller, who shifted and short-thrust with the scimitar. The Bhalong fell to the deck, throat opened, choking her life out.

Afya vaulted over her victim and went to the old evil whaling lance mounted on the bulkhead, prying at a bracket with her knife. The sailors gaped at her. “That shark will be upon us in moments!” she shouted. “We’ve got women over the side!” At that they lent their stringth, bending the brackets in earnest.

Afya and her shipmates had just got the old weapon free, and brought it to the rail, when the shark watch sang out, “Shark below, close astern!” And then it came.

Like a moving gray hill surfacing under the water, the monster’s immense head lifted out of the dull depths. It came from underneath, gape-jawed, an ambush predator. Under Rahifa and the cat.

Rahifa, feeling the lifting surge, kicked out desperately to avoid the rising strike. She just managed it, but the huge body hurtled up next to her, the gigantic dorsal fin striking her ribcage with crushing force. She somehow kept Belladonna in her arms as the suction of the monster’s lift slammed her into the shark’s abrasive flank again, tumbling her with raw flayed skin. The shark’s huge body lunged up, half its length out of the water, huge jaws gaping. The sailors gaped in dread.

Then, with all of the smooth power of her long muscles, Afya hurled the lance.

Lances are for thrusting, not throwing, but the throw went true. Its chisel-shaped head struck the huge shark in the gills, striking through to jut from its other side. In agony, the great animal curved and crashed into the water, hurling a huge wave and blast of bloody spray—and then it sank into the deeps again, and was gone, to die soon of its wound or to live, transfixed by the lance. Afya had seen sharks survive even when horribly injured. Merciless though she was, she spared a thought of pity for the terrible brute. It was merely a predator. The cult of Arusimaté had drawn it into evil service.

“Rahifa!” shouted Afya. “Grab the line, girl!” A Paritid sailor had skillfully cast a coil of line within easy reach. Rahifa’s strong grip closed on the hemp, and the sailors drew her in, pulling towards the ladder that had been dropped over the side.

At the same time, some of the Bhalong had similarly cast a line to the Captain. They all hauled in. “Avast there!” Afya sang out. “Rahifa comes up the ladder first.” The Bhalong rounded on her, hostile, rolling their eyes and gnashing their teeth. They drew their long knives. Afya was pleased to see it; while they menaced her, they were not hauling the Captain in any further.

“You’re no captain of ours!” they shouted. 

“Bhalong say that a lot, seemingly,” Afya snarled. The scimitar lay on the deck near the bulkhead where the whaling lance had been mounted, so she drew her own knife and sprang toward them, then ducked aside as they leaped at her, blades hissing close.

They were strong and horribly quick. They drove her back, pelting into her like a wave coming across the deck. But this was a woman who had danced through ankle-deep blood on more than one vessel. Slipping aside, shifting, fading, she led them back toward the aft cabin. Their fierce blows missed her, or left thin red slices on her dark skin. But then another sailor bounded to the deck behind her, an Antarctic woman with heavy shoulders and a cruel twist to her face. Her knife sank into Afya’s back, but not far, striking the shoulder blade and halting there for a moment. Afya threw herself forward, a splash of blood trailing from her torn back, bright red against the jet-black skin. She staggered three steps forward—and then went down upon her hands and knees. Her hand, though, fell unerringly on the hilt of the scimitar she’d dropped when they wrested the lance away from the bulkhead.

Afya Mankiller rose sword in hand from the deck with a bound like a catapult releasing, howling a berserk shriek, the whirl of the scimitar no more silver than her mad molten eyes. The sailors who had been chasing her were themselves too infuriated to pause, and flung themselves upon her.

Against Afya, famous swordswoman of the bloody Brass Ocean, that sinewy growling rush seemed slow and cumbersome. She flowed around and through them, dancing, slicing, surefooted. Their blows missed. Hers did not. In moments, three Bhalong and one Antarctic sprawled on the rolling deck, dead or dying. 

Afya shook her head, mumbling past a smashed lip, “What other bitches.” She spat, coughed, shook her bloodstreaked silvergreen mane, shouted, “_What other bitches_ want to say I’m not the Captain? Come forth, as many of you as dare!” Her voice spiraled up into the scream of a seabutcher bird. “Come forth, sadpuppies, and I’ll spill your guts until the honest crew can scarce walk the deck!”

She was a terrible sight, tall, gaunt, brown and black, slashed with wounds, blood from a shrewd slash on her forehead leaking down into her eyes so that she must keep shaking her head to clear it; standing slinky as a dancer, lethal as a cobra, casting her malignant gaze fore and aft, gripping a blood-clotted sword that dripped on the deck.

“Nay, Afya!” shouted Seiche Pikati. “I knew you, did I not? I knew you, and I will sail with you. I will sail with you, pirate or merchant!” The small scrawny woman whirled. “What say you, shipmates?”

At first the Paritids, and then, by twos and threes, the entire surviving crew of _Ragfin_ shouted their acclaim. Basilika, the ship’s Figurator, nodded, looking at Afya with dark, narrow eyes.

Squallbone Ponela was shouting for her shipmates to come hoist the goddess-despised ladder. Afya went to the rail with others, and she saw a strange sight: Belladonna clinging to the ladder’s ropes with tail and clawed handpaws; below her Rahifa, bloody and battered, plainly beyond moving anymore, but with her arm hooked through the rungs like grim death; and below that, Skoan Usad, one-armed, trying to scale the ladder as well, with her dagger gripped in her teeth.

They began to haul. Belladonna crawled up onto the gunwale, protesting in her thin wailing voice. Then Rahifa was within reach, and Afya shouldered her way to gently lift the girl, taking care for the broken bones and torn skin; but also with some haste lest the Captain manage one more stroke with the dagger.

Skoan Usad snarled, removed the dagger from her mouth, and chuckled. “You do not have my ship yet, Eastwind Shen. No—Afya, the name is. You shall fight me with your knife.” Her face was gone in mad hatred. Her horrid knotted muscles swelled. Then she shouted, with that hoarse booming voice, “_Crew Oath!_ Obey and take the castaways!”

The Oath had been considerably frayed by Tryggva’s nights of work on the Watch Hexmark, and Skoan Usad was hurt and hanging over the side, where her command could not be well heard. Nonetheless, so mighty was her Captain’s voice that the crew faltered and looked from side to side, trapped between the tatters of Skoan Usad’s authority and the new power of Afya. Afya, holding Rahifa as gently as she could, was trapped. She surged back to get away from the rail—but then a huge grip fell upon her arms. The Bosun grinned down at her.

Afya chose that moment to yield to Tryggva Steinlaugsdottir. Tryggva became aware behind Eastwind’s eyes, eyes that faded from the silver of combat and strife to the pale graygreen of considered thought. Tryggva felt Afya’s skill and ferocity leave her; but she understood the situation well enough. She sang out, with a clear crisp voice, the Oration she had prepared in the watches of the night, while she labored over the Hexmark.

It was not really a proper Oration—far too simple and brief. Barely a cantrip, if truth be told. But unlike the Orations whose subtle power is to cultivate insight and diverse powers of the Interior Mind, this Oration served only a single purpose: to disrupt one particular influence. It was crafted solely to break the grip of the _Ragfin_’s Crew Oath. Tryggva cast it in one long compelling cry that carried across _Ragfin_’s decks and up into the rigging.

The sailors, decisively freed at last of the brutal hold of that Oath, seemed like women newly awakened, trying to recall a memory from long ago. The one terrible exception was the Bosun, who followed Skoan Usad, and worshipped Arusimaté, because she chose to. Her crushing grip on Tryggva’s arms tightened… and then Skoan Usad, bloody, grinning, a monster, heaved herself up to the rail, right in front of Tryggva.

Tryggva’s mind went white and blank. She was a scholar and Figurator, not a warrior like Afya nor a brawler like Eastwind. She had done what she needed to do, but now it seemed all for nothing. She watched Skoan’s knife rise for a terrible stab, and could think of nothing to do.

The giant shark erupted again out of the depths then, enraged, biting in a frenzy. It surged up in a horrible gray mass, its jaws engulfing Skoan Usad’s middle body, and some of the hull strakes, with a terrible grating crunch. Skoan’s eyes widened in horrible incomprehension, and then she was dragged away and down, departing _Ragfin_ forever. The waters closed over her and her Guide with a terrific bloody splash.

Eastwind came aware again. She no longer had Tryggva’s command of the acts of the inner mind, and could only vaguely remember the act of casting the Oration, but the Oration itself still resonated in her. The Crew Oath was lifted.

And Eastwind was more than capable of dealing with the Bosun.


###To Flotsam


The _Ragfin_, under Eastwind’s captaincy, seemed to throw off the sullen miasma of evil as it pressed west by south, heading out again the the ring of the Gyre. The Bosun lay in sick bay, her jaw shattered and teeth splintered. The corpse of the Shark Priestess had been cast over the side, drawing the immediate attention of some of the lesser sharks that haunted the weed drifts. All agreed that this was ecologically fitting.

The whaling weapons were broken up, the shafts burned and the irons salvaged: steel that had been put to evil purposes could be made clean again in a forge. Basilika, silent and withdrawn, scoured, replotted, and regraved the Watch Hex to more wholesome purpose.

Squallbone and Seiche went up the foremast top and reverently brought the mummified Passage Bird down. Rather than throw it to the predators of the sea, the _Ragfin_ hove to near a hunched, hillocky mat of raftweed, not too large but stable. They lowered the carcase there, hoping that its spirit would ascend in good time.

Rahifa also lay in sick bay, and did not prosper. Basilika had put forth all of her skill, and sung all of the healing songs she knew, but Rahifa was grievously hurt and sailed her own journey in the Death Sea. None could tell whether she would return, or she would find her way to Makarita and tie up there. Belladonna neglected her pest-catching duties shamefully, lying next to Rahifa and purring without pause. “Cat’s calling her back,” the sailors said.

						#

As they sailed back out to the fringes of Bad Water, the skies changed again. Eastwind, at a particularly wild sunset, climbed the maintop and cried with all her heart to Lasirenn. <i>Come and speak with me, Beautiful Girl. Come and find me again, you. My love lies dying, she, and my ship has no guidance to the only place where she might find healing.</i> The words seemed to echo away into the high clouds and under the water. At long last, the flat muffled dullness of her spiritual ears opened out.

<i>“Well enough,”</i> came Lasirenn’s reply, faint, but growing clearer. <i>“Well enough… Have you learned not to traffic with horrible sickfish shark? You like those shark cults, eh?”</i>

<i>Not in the least, no.</i> Eastwind recalled with a sick sensation what it had been like to take the Crew Oath and to swear by the Shark God. Shamed, she let that memory flow to Lasirenn.

<i>“Arusimaté. He and I, we have battled down the centuries. We hate one another dearly… I understand you couldn’t avoid this. But don’t ever fuck up like this again.”</i>

Tears streamed down Eastwind’s dark face. <i>Thank you, Lasirenn. Never leave you again, me.</i> The wild clouds, like brooms and feathers, flared out around the setting sun.

“Your hair is so beautiful,” she whispered aloud.

The next morning, the sailors saw a wonderful and heartening thing. A Passage Bird, looking translucent in the predawn air, winged in from astern and perched on the foretop. They knew it was their guide to Flotsam.
						#

“How many of you are there?” asked Basilika one evening, idly, as _Ragfin_ plunged into the roaring sequence of storms and clear thundering north wind that marked the Ring, the outer edge of the Gyre. She and Eastwind were on the stern deck, smoking, for smoking in sick bay was thought to be bad. Heavy banks of cloud raced overhead in the darkness, occluding and revealing the stars. “I’ve seen Afya and Tryggva. Even though Afya hid from me when I Heard your truth.”

Eastwind shrugged. “Few more. How many, not even entirely sure, me. I’m newest, youngest. Was upset when I realized my predecessors don’t tell me everything. Secretive, they.” Her pipe glowed as she puffed on it. “But they made me for a reason. Primary, I am, now.”

“This is a secret you wish kept.”

“Yes. You tell anybody, soon I have to construct another voice, another personality, supersede me.”

“Strange life.” Basilika’s voice was meditative.

“Life I have, me.”

						#

They had Flotsam in sight, the morning that Rahifa woke, coming back from her long journey on the seas near death. Wrapped in bandages. She smiled brilliantly at Eastwind, a lover’s smile. Basilika, standing on the bed’s other side, eyes glistening, nudged her head No.

“My girl,” said Eastwind. “Like to get some fresh air, you? Flotsam off the starboard bow, and a beautiful morning out there.” Belladonna stretched an headbutted Rahifa gently.

“Consensus, seems,” the patient whispered. Sailors bore her gently up to the stern deck.

It was a glorious morning, with a lifting wind from the south. _Ragfin_ was close hauled on the port tack, the crush and splash of the hull crisp and clean. The rising sun burned redgold off the port quarter. The Passage Bird circled the ship, crying its cries of the vastness of the sea, and winged off towards the floating island that so few women had ever seen.

Flotsam was a vast wrinkled mass, miles across, heaped high, partly cloaked in mist. Centuries of wind and wave had humped its ever-thickening mats up into a series of ridges and folds, fading inland. The swells broke against the near shore in a white froth, but Eastwind suddenly realized that Flotsam trailed underwater reefs behind it, and great waves towered up there. The wind was offshore, and it pressed the breaking waves into glorious peaks of glittering blue and green. Rahifa saw it too, and smiled. “What wonderful surf breaks,” she murmured.

They lay on a bench, Eastwind’s arms around Rahifa. Belladonna snuggled up against Rahifa’s other side, purring and croaking.

“Eastwind,” said Rahifa. “Remember surfing together at Petals Reef? You carried me in your arms and on your shoulders, you.”

“Yes.” Eastwind smiled. “Together on the board, we, standing. I held you. You put out a foot, and cut the face of the wave with your toe.”

“That was the third best time, in all my life, me,” Rahifa said. “…I think I go tie up Makarita Pier now, me.”

“No, Rahifa, stay with me a while longer.”

“Can really use a drink, me,” Rahifa said dreamily. “But I will stay with you a little longer.”

“Eastwind, it’s getting cold. Kiss me.” And her lips were cold indeed.

“Eastwind… I’m glad we are here, and glad I saw this. Promise me…”

“Anything,” Eastwind said.

“Take me surfing on those breaks.”

“Yes. I will take you surfing.”

Rahifa smiled, and lifted her face to kiss Eastwind again, and looked again out at the breaks of Flotsam. Her eyes were bright and clear. “Why, there it is!” she cried. And Rahifa Ruan never spoke again.

Eastwind Shen wept long. The rigging cat mewed and purred and tried to warm her girl, but even her great heart could not bring Rahifa back. And Lasirenn’s blazing hair unfurled redgold overhead, in a deep blue sky that spoke of storms to come, next day, or the day after.
